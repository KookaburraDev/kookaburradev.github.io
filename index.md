# Welcome
## About me
I make software that helps with the little things, such as a basic user-friendly Location Management System.

## Programs
### In development
- LCM App
A user friendly Location Management System designed for whatever you need it for. I had the problem of always loosing cables or not being able to find them, but now look up where they are. I can also look for anything in each particular draw, set of draws, or even each individual household.

### Future plans
- LCM Web
A web-based version of LCM App. More intitive and easier to use, mobile-friendly and possible expansion to a [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) (Progressive Web App).
